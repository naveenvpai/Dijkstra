 *
 * Pole:
 *
 * This class serves as a representation of two nodes and the edge that connects them (a piece of a Graph).
 *
 * Note: the idea for this model came from a conceptual discussion with Matthew Seligson.
 * In class, we talked about the way to represent nodes, how to store adjacency matrices, etc.
 * however, no code was shared, copied, or referenced.
 *
 * Each field of Pole is an integer:
 *  start   - the index that represents the first node
 *  edge    - the edge (cost, distance, etc.) of the connecting edge
 *  end     - the index that represents the second node.
 *
 *  This class implements Comparable because it is intended to be inserted into a Priority Queue.
 *      * only the edge (i.e. distance or cost) is used for comparison between poles
 *      * the Pole is only intended to be compared to other Poles.
