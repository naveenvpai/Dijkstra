 * Dijkstra:
 *
 * This class holds the shortestPath method, the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
 * This file contains only static fields and methods, and is not intended for use through instance methods.
 * This class incorporates the Pole class through instantiation in the shortestPath methods, and other helpers.
 * The private helper methods are found after the shortestPath method, organized alphabetically.
 * The demonstration of functionality is found in the TestDijkstra class, where the main method is located
 * Documentation is in the form of /** comments in front of each method.
 * In line comments are found only at key areas that require explanation.
